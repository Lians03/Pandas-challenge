# pandas-challenge
**Summary**

In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of school performance using Python and Pandas. I began by determining the total number of unique schools and then categorized schools based on spending per student, school size, and school type. I calculated averages for math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, for each category. The results were assembled into clear and concise DataFrames, providing a comprehensive overview of how different factors impact school performance. The findings highlighted insights into the relationship between spending, school size, and school type with academic success. This project not only showcased my proficiency in data analysis but also provided valuable information for informed decision-making in the realm of education.

**Conclusions and Comparisons**
1.	The percentage of students passing math, reading, and overall in Charter schools is significantly higher than in District schools. Charter schools have a passing rate of 93.62% in math, 96.59% in reading, and an impressive overall passing rate of 90.43%. In contrast, district schools had lower rates in all subjects, with 66.55% passing in mathematics, 80.80% passing in reading and 53.67% in overall. 
2.	During the study, I find that smaller sized schools, such as Holden High School and Pena High School, showcase higher percentages for passing math, reading, and overall passing compared to larger schools like Bailey High School and Hernandez High School. This data suggests that smaller schools, with potentially more personalized learning environments, might contribute to a higher student success rate.
