# pandas-challenge
In this project, I conducted a detailed analysis of school performance using Python and Pandas. I began by determining the total number of unique schools and then categorized schools based on spending per student, school size, and school type. I calculated averages for math and reading scores, as well as passing percentages, for each category. The results were assembled into clear and concise DataFrames, providing a comprehensive overview of how different factors impact school performance. The findings highlighted insights into the relationship between spending, school size, and school type with academic success. This project not only showcased my proficiency in data analysis but also provided valuable information for informed decision-making in the realm of education.
